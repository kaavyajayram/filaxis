          <h3>It's time to take control of your audience.</h3>
          <p>Let's face the facts: your income on social media rests on the approval of your fans. When your behavior
            doesn't live up to the expectations of your constituency, you can end up personally responsible for the
            things you've said. Your followers won't give you time to explain yourself before they come to consensus
            about your failures - and we understand. We give you time to learn from your mistakes, even when Twitter and
            Instagram don't. </p>

          <p>Filaxis Insurance Company is now offering a unique Influencer Cancellation Insurance (ICI) package. For
            account holders with subscriber-based incomes we offer full income-lost coverage in the case of a sudden
            loss of subscribership. ICI covers costs associated with PR management such as non-monetizable apology
