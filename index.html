        <h3>It's time to take control of your audience.</h3>
        <p>Let's face the facts: your income on social media rests on the approval of your fans. When your behavior
          doesn't live up to the expectations of your constituency, you can end up personally responsible for the
          things you've said. Your followers won't give you time to explain yourself before they come to consensus
          about your failures - and we understand. We give you time to learn from your mistakes, even when Twitter and
          Instagram don't. </p>

      <h3>This Is Not Real... </h3>
      <p> ...it is a piece of satire. This is a terrible business model that does not make sense for
        a number of reasons. 'Disgrace insurance' is already a concept in the film industry, but it is purchased on part of
        the studio and often packaged with other kinds of film insurance by default so as not to insinuate disgrace on
        part of the actors or producers. 'Cancellation insurance' would be a product marketed toward petty celebrities
        and/or other public figures who feel the need to hedge bets either against themselves or against what they
        perceive as an ignorant populace.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now that we've thoroughly deflated the joke we'd like to give credit to the 'Blue Check Homes' viral art project
        for
        inspiring this. This project is in no way associated with 'Blue Check Homes' or its creator.

        <br>
        <br>
        If you were seriously considering spending money on this service we recommend you put that money towards
        any
        of the following organizations.

        <br>
        <br>
        To recap:
        <br>
          <p>- If you believed this was real and acted on it in earnest we hope you audit your
            intuitions in the future.
          <p>
          <p>- If you unironically want to make this a reality then you are a vampire, or at the very
            least a dark burueamancer and we hope whatever eventually does you in has less spite in its heart than you.
