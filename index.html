        <h3>Influencer "Cancellation" Insurance</h3>

        <h3>It's time to take control of your audience.</h3>
        <p>Let's face the facts: your income on social media rests on the approval of your fans. When your behavior
          doesn't live up to the expectations of your constituency, you can end up personally responsible for the
          things you've said. Your followers won't give you time to explain yourself before they come to consensus
          about your failures - and we understand. We give you time to learn from your mistakes, even when Twitter and
          Instagram don't. </p>

        <h3>Show your fans that you care about how they feel, and do so with financial confidence. </h3>
        <p>Filaxis Insurance Company is now offering a unique Influencer Cancellation Insurance (ICI) package. For
          account holders with subscriber-based incomes we offer full income-lost coverage in the case of a sudden
          loss of subscribership. ICI covers costs associated with PR management such as non-monetizable apology
          content, sensitivity training, and retainer fees. </p>

            <h3>This Is Not Real </h3>
            <p> This is not real – it is a piece of satire. This is a terrible business model that would be unethical in a number of ways. `Disgrace insurance` is already a concept in the film industry, but it is purchased on part of the studio and often packaged with other kinds of film insurance by default so as not to insinuate disgrace on part of the actors or producers. "Cancellation" insurance would be a product marketed toward petty C-listers who feel the need to hedge bets either against themselves or against what they perceive as an ignorant public. Now that I’ve thoroughly deflated the joke I’d like to give credit to the `Blue Check Homes` viral art project for inspiring this. This project is in no ways associated with `Blue Check Homes` or its creator.
            <br> If you were seriously considering spending money on this service I reccomend you put that money towards any of the following organizations. If you believed this was real and acted on it in earnest I hope you audit your intuitions in the future. If you unironically want to make this a reality then you are a vampire, or at the very least a dark burueamancer and I hope whatever does you in has less spite in its heart than you.</p>
