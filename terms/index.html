        The relays of cool shade will
        disperse you, and maybe, in the span of near endless eons, you will be more or less corporeal again, continuity

        The fourth stage is pure simulacrum, in which the simulacrum has no relationship to any reality whatsoever.
        Here, signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of images or signs is only of the
        order of other such claims. This is a regime of total equivalency, where cultural products need no longer even
        pretend to be real in a na√Øve sense, because the experiences of consumers' lives are so predominantly artificial
        that even claims to reality are expected to be phrased in artificial, "hyperreal" terms. Any naive pretension to
        reality as such is perceived as bereft of critical self-awareness, and thus as oversentimental.

        The black soldier fly (BSFL) is a great source of fatty acids and is used in many hair products as well
        as
        a feed for stock chickens. Strangely, the etymology of the order `Diptera` has nothing to do with the etymology
        of
        'Diptheria', and neither BSFL nor any other animals of the order Diptera are known carriers of the bacteria
        Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

        Carcinisation (or carcinization) is an example of convergent evolution in which a crustacean evolves into a
        crab-like form from a non-crab-like form. Carcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least
        five groups of decapod crustaceans.

        Adobe Portable Display Format. The spiders are here and you must let them in. We reserve the right to let the
        spiders in. Once you purchase your Policy, you will be given the opportunity to download a
        free
        copy of Adobe Reader so that you can view Insurance Policy Documents in Adobe Portable Display Format. If you
        consent to receive Insurance Policy Documents electronically, you must have: (i) a computer capable of

        not have the Technical Requirements, you cannot receive Insurance Policy Documents electronically.

        <h3>This Is Not Real... </h3>
        <p> ...it is a piece of satire. 'Disgrace insurance' is already a concept in the film industry, but it is
          purchased on part of the studio and often packaged with other kinds of film insurance by default so as
          to not insinuate disgrace on part of the actors or producers.
          'Cancellation insurance' is the hypothetical next iteration of this - a product marketed toward petty
          celebrities
          and/or other public figures who feel the need to hedge bets either against themselves or against what they
          perceive as an ignorant populace.
          <br>

          Now that we've thoroughly deflated the joke we'd like to give credit to the 'Blue Check Homes' viral art
          project
          for
          inspiring this. This project is in no way associated with 'Blue Check Homes' or its creator.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you believed this was real and acted on it in earnest we hope you audit your
          intuitions in the future, or at the very least read the fine print first.
